In this way, we would show that we take Ukraine\\'s application seriously,\" it added.\\nFrance and Germany have so far played their cards close to their chests. \\nBut both they and Sweden were part of a group that still had \"questions and reservations\" an EU diplomat said. The group also included Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain, the diplomat said. \\nThe fear was that some might call for \"unrealistic\" reforms in Ukraine before granting EU candidacy, effectively kicking the process into the long grass, a second EU diplomat said. \\n\"And of course if Ukraine doesn\\'t get it, the other two [Georgia and Moldova] can forget about anything,\" the diplomat added. \\nBut with EU unanimity required to go ahead, a second fear is that EU states with close Russia ties might sabotage the process with a veto. \\nHungary recently vetoed an EU oil embargo on Russia and the blacklisting of a top Russian churchman in what some diplomats say might \"embolden\" further action in future. \\n\"I think it will be possible to pacify them [wary countries such as Denmark and the Netherlands],\" a third EU source said. \\n\"I\\'m more fearful of Russian stooges, meaning Cyprus, Hungary, Austria, Malta,\" the source said. \\nIn the background, the US and the UK have been historically in favour of EU enlargement in eastern Europe, but the UK\\'s voice counts for little after Brexit, EU sources said.\\nMatter of time?\\nMeanwhile, the Ukrainian ambassador to the EU, Vsevolod Chentsov, voiced optimism on Sunday that \"Ukraine\\'s fully-fledged EU membership is just a matter of time\". \\nAny country seeking EU candidacy status must complete an onerous EU Commission questionnaire hundreds of pages long. \\nAnd Chentsov underlined that this was no ordinary application. \\n\"Ukraine did it in a record high speed under war conditions, while all the government, ministries and respective institutions involved in working on the questionnaire were in Kyiv, under Russian shelling and constant air raids,\" he told EUobserver. \\nAsked how he thought Russia might react if EU leaders took a positive decision next week, Chentsov said Russia should \"stop this savage war\" and \"finally start taking care of its own people\" instead. \\n\"Looting by Russian soldiers in Ukraine demonstrates the level of misery and degradation of this country [Russia],\" he said.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n, your membership gives you access to all of our stories.
